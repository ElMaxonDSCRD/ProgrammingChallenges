# Programming Challenges v4.0

[Source](https://github.com/JeremyJaydan/programming-challenges)

This is my take on all the challenges of this image I found browsing the
Internet. It seemed really interesting for me to try and beat some challenges
and I decided to create this repo to write some code for those challenges. I
will be solving those challenges in no pre-defined order, with the languages I
think fit the most for me.

Here is my progress so far (tip: you can sort this list using
