# nÂ°44 - FizzBuzz

What better way to start than with the classic programming challenge, FizzBuzz!  
I will be writing the code with Rust, as I am currently learning it. It should 
be pretty simple, because I already coded a FizzBuzz program before in some 
other languages before.

## Starting the challenge

First, I create a new directory that I name `44-fizzbuzz` inside the
`Challenges` directory. To create a new Rust project, I use the `cargo new`
command and I give it the name of my project, which is `fizzbuzz`. I can start
writing code in the `main.rs` file, located inside the `src` directory.  

I then document myself on what a FizzBuzz program is, and how it works. I've
already programmed a FizzBuzz program before, but it's always good to have a
description of what the program should do.  

According to [this](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_Buzz) Wikipedia article,
FizzBuzz is a game for children to learn about counting. The rules are simple:
you start by counting up indefinitely, and if you see a number that is divisible
by 3, you say "Fizz!" instead, when it's divisible by 5, you say "Buzz!",
and when it's divisible by both, say "FizzBuzz!" The article also states that
writing an implementation of this game is widely asked during programming
interviews, to analyze the coding style and habits of the interviewee. So, let's
start with the code!

## Solving the challenge

I start by creating a function named `fizzbuzz` that takes a positive number as 
an argument and returns nothing.

```rs
fn fizzbuzz(n: u32) {}
```

Then, I write a simple for loop inside of this function, which loops over a
range from 1 to n, included. To specify that I want the n to be included, I use
the `..=` syntax.

```rs
for i in 1..=n {
    // ...
}
```

Inside this for loop, I first check if the current number is not a multiple of
3 or 5. To do that, I use the `%` operator, which returns the remainder of a
division. If the remainder is 0, then the number is a multiple of the number I'm
checking, else, it's not. For example, `9 % 3` returns `0`, so `9` is a multiple
of `3`. In my code, if the number is not a multiple of 3 or 5, it just prints
the said number and continues over to the next iteration, without doing anything 
else.

```rs
for i in 1..=n {
    if i % 3 != 0 && i % 5 != 0 {
        println!("{}", i);
        continue;
    }
    // ...
}
```

If the number does not pass the first check, it means that it is a multiple of
3 or 5, if not both. I start by checking if it's a multiple of 3, and if it is,
it prints "Fizz", without adding a new line, using the `print!` macro. If it's
a multiple of 5, it prints "Buzz", also with the `print!` macro. The reason I
use the `print!` macro instead of the `println!` macro is that if the number
is a multiple of both 3 and 5, I want to print "FizzBuzz!", and I don't want to
add an unnecessary if statement which would check if the number is divisible by
both 3 and 5. Finally, it prints an exclamation mark followed by new line.

```rs
for i in 1..=n {
    // ...
    if i % 3 == 0 {
        print!("Fizz");
    }
    if i % 5 == 0 {
        print!("Buzz");
    }
    println!("!");
}
```

And there we go! We have a fully functional FizzBuzz function! We just need to
call it from the main function, and we're done! To run the code, simply execute
the following command: `cargo run`.

### Final code

```rs
fn main() {
    fizzbuzz(150);
}

fn fizzbuzz(n: u32) {
    for i in 1..=n {
        if i % 3 != 0 && i % 5 != 0 {
            println!("{}", i);
            continue;
        }
        if i % 3 == 0 {
            print!("Fizz");
        }
        if i % 5 == 0 {
            print!("Buzz");
        }
        println!("!");
    }
}
```

You can see a commented version of this code inside `main.rs` file located in
the `src` folder.
