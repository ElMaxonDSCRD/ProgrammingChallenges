# nÂ°4 - Markov Chain Sentence Generator

Second challenge on the list, a Markov Chain Sentence Generator! This generator
will also be written in Rust. I have already heard about Markov Chains before
but I don't actually know how they work and what they are supposed to do. So
let's start doing some research and implementing an algorithm for generating
those Markov Chains!

## Starting the challenge

As usual, I create my new Rust project with `cargo new`. I name this project
`4-markov_chain` and I start by opening the `main.rs` file using my IDE.

I First need to document myself on Markov Chains. A quick web search leads me to
[this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain) Wikipedia page.
